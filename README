checkcopy
=======

Version 0.2, released 2009-0X-XX

This program will copy one or more files / directories to a destination,
and compute an md5 checksum on the fly. Currently the .md5 files are generated
per directory.


==============================================================================
Usage
-----

The source files / directories have to be specified on the command line. Then
a dialog will pop up asking you for the destination, unless it was also
specified on the command line (-d switch).

This should allow easy bindings in file managers.


W A R N I N G:
  Similarly to how `cp' works, checkcopy currently overwrites destination
  files without warning!


The checksum will be saved in one .md5 file per directory. So if you have a
layout like:
a/
  sub1/
    (some files)
  sub2/
    (some files)

you would end up with the following checksum files:
a/sub1/sub1.md5
a/sub2/sub2.md5

Note that there is no a/a.md5, because there were no files (just directories)
inside of a/.


I recommend the program `cfv' to verify files. cfv has the `-r' switch, which
allows you to verify a whole directory structure copied with checkcopy.


==============================================================================
Requirements
------------

checkcopy requires the following libraries to be installed:
 * gtk+ toolkit:
    it was tested with gtk 2.12.11, but probably gtk 2.10 would suffice
 * mhash library:
    it was tested with 0.9.9 (libmhash2 in Debian)
    the manpage refers to 0.9.2, so I assume that's the minimum required


==============================================================================
Compiling
---------

The mhash library seems poorly maintained. Quoting
http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-bugs/2008/10/19/msg028900.html :

---SNIP---
        The package security/mhash installs a file in
        /usr/pkg/include/mhash.h that has the effect of including
        mhash's config.h generated by autoconf, which is intended for
        use internal to the program of which config.h is a part.  Any
        other program that uses autoconf will have trouble reconciling
        mhash's config.h with its own config.h, since they define many
        macros in common, such as PACKAGE_NAME and PACKAGE_VERSION.

>How-To-Repeat:

        Install security/mhash and try to build a C program that uses
        autoconf and includes <mhash.h>.

>Fix:

        Patch /usr/pkg/include/mhash.h to strike out the line
        
                #define MUTILS_USE_MHASH_CONFIG
        
        which has no useful effects of which I am aware for programs
        outside of mhash.  It may be possible to patch the source file
        mhash-0.9.9/include/mhash.h -- other C source files in mhash
        already define MUTILS_USE_MHASH_CONFIG before including it.

        This should probably also be reported upstream, but mhash looks
        awfully defunct upstream.  <http://mhash.sf.net/> is rather
        outdated, and the version one finds in CVS is older than the
        version one finds in the distribution tarballs.
---SNAP---

This fix is NOT necessary with checkcopy. In fact, if implemented compilation
will fail, at least under Debian. Instead, checkcopy's config.h is included
after mhash.h, so that it overwrites any conflicting definitions. Compiler
warnings about redefined preprocesor symbols are fixed in mhash-fix.h. Patches
are welcome.
