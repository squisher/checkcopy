md5copy
=======

Version 0.1, released 2008-07-20

This program will copy one or more files / directories to a destination,
and compute an md5 checksum on the fly. Currently the .md5 files are generated
per directory.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage
-----

The source files / directories have to be specified on the command line. Then
a dialog will pop up asking you for the destination, unless it was also
specified on the command line (-d switch).

This should allow easy bindings in file managers.


W A R N I N G:
  Similarly to how `cp' works, md5copy currently overwrites destination
  files without warning!


The checksum will be saved in one .md5 file per directory. So if you have a
layout like:
a/
  sub1/
    (some files)
  sub2/
    (some files)

you would end up with the following checksum files:
a/sub1/sub1.md5
a/sub2/sub2.md5

Note that there is no a/a.md5, because there were no files (just directories)
inside of a/.


I recommend the program `cfv' to verify files. cfv has the `-r' switch, which
allows you to verify a whole directory structure copied with md5copy.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements
------------

md5copy requires the following libraries to be installed:
 * gtk+ toolkit:
    it was tested with gtk 2.12.11, but probably gtk 2.10 would suffice
 * mhash library:
    it was tested with 0.9.9 (libmhash2 in Debian)
    the manpage refers to 0.9.2, so I assume that's the minimum required
